If you're reading this post, you're probably already on [ianmcg.dev](https://ianmcg.dev), welcome! This site is the hub
for all of my recent projects, relevant experience, and ways to get in contact. 

This site is build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator using a modified version
of the [Gokarna](https://github.com/gokarna-theme/gokarna-hugo) theme, personalized for my needs. It's deployed using 
[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) for fast global performance and minimal infrastructure overhead.
This combination allows for a very fast and efficient development pipeline. You can find the source code for this
projec ton my [GitHub](https://github.com/Wiian16/hugo-portfolio).

Beyond a simple portfolio, this domain is also the entry point to my homelab, currently running on a Dell OptiPlex 
running [TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/). For example: [my resume](/r/resume/) is
hosted on a containerized WebDAV server. I'm always working to add more tools and keep everything up to date, so please
be patient if a resource is unavailable.

This project is a mix of my interests in software engineering, infrastructure, and web development, as well as a window
into my life as a developer.
