# Hello, I'm Ian McGillivary

I’m a Computer Science student at Indiana University specializing in Software Engineering, with a minor in 
Environmental Science. I’m passionate about building practical, efficient software and solving real-world 
problems—whether that’s through teaching, collaborating at hackathons, or exploring new technologies on my own time.

You can find my work online under the handle **Wiian16**, including on GitHub, where I share projects and experiments
as I continue growing as a developer. I’m currently looking for internship opportunities where I can contribute to
meaningful projects and develop my skills in a collaborative environment.
